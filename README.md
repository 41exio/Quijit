### Generate a Quiz From a CSV File

**Note:**
	* The csv file will not load if you are on Windows and don't have Excel installed.
	* Funny things might happen with quotes in the csv file...
	* I don't take any responsibility for anything.
	* Use at own risk...

* Load a csv file with the following headers:
    * question
    * snippet
    * answer
    * false1
    * ...
    * falseN
* snippet is optional, you can probably have 1-9 false answers.

## To run:
1. Download [Quijit](https://github.com/41exio/Quijit/releases/latest/download/Quijit.zip)
2. Open index.html with Chrome (might work in other browsers, let me know if any issues).
3. Load in .csv file.
4. Profit???
